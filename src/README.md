# Star Lanes, Rust

This is a port of the classic BASIC game [Star Lanes] to Rust.

## Usage

This is a library and binary package.

To run the game with the classic interface with just a few minor changes:

```
cargo run
```

## The Library

The library portion has been written with the intent that front-ends are
relatively easy to bolt on.

`main.rs` is an example.

## License

All my code is Unlicensed. However, the game itself contains text that
is copyrighted by the original author. I plead fair use for that, but if
you're still out there, Steven Faber, drop me a line.
